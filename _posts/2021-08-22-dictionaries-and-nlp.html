  If you've read the previous post, then you shouldn't be too surprised that
  computational linguists don't think of dictionaries as old dusty tomes with no
  purpose other than fitting the height of their computer screen (well, perhaps
  some do).

  Likewise, it's not like science was invented in the last century. Case in
  point, lexicographers are generally familiar with the "Aristotelian
  definition", which is more or less a rule of thumb for producing useful
  definitions. The method goes as follows: when you define something, start by
  stating what kind of thing it is. For instance: a duck is a kind of bird, a
  hammer is a kind of tool, and so on. Then state what differentiates that thing
  from others of the same kind: a duck is
  <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/duck#Noun">an aquatic bird with a flat
  bill and webbed feet</a>; a hammer is
  <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hammer#Noun">a tool with a heavy head
  used for pounding</a>.
</p>
<aside>
  <b>Note:</b>
  As we scientists like to sound smart, we use the latin words "genus" and
  "differentia" rather than the English "kind" and "differentiating
  characteristics". Aside from this smartipantiness, this methodology has other
  obvious shortcomings. For one thing, it works okay with most concrete things,
  but things get messy very quickly when you try to apply it to abstract nouns,
  verbs, adjectives, or even common words such as "ouch".
</aside>
<p>
  The Aristotelian definition is a good starting point when studying definition
  writing. Poetically, it also proves to be a good starting point for NLP
  scientists working with dictionaries. In 1985, Chodorow, Byrd and Heidorn
  suggested that you could leverage Aristotelian definitions to construct
  semantic hierarchies. Going back to our example of "duck", we see that the
  first noun in that definition is the genus, "bird". On the other hand, if you
  look it up, you'll find that
  <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/mallard#English">"mallard"</a>,
  <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/scaup#English">"scaup"</a> or
  <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pochard#English">"pochard"</a> all use
  "duck" as their genera.
</p>
<p>
  This should come as no surprise to the duck-lovers among my readers, but they
  are probably few. For the others, I strongly encourage you to reach out to
  your inner old-lady-near-a-pond-surronded-by-way-too-many-birds. Or to google
  those words. Anyways, they are kinds of ducks. I know because I googled
  "kinds of ducks" when writing this post.
</p>
<p>
  The more linguistically oriented among my readers, while they may not be the
  truest of anatidaephiles, will have noticed that the genus is a hypernym of
  the word being defined. All ducks are birds; all mallards are ducks; and using
  Aristotelian definitions, we can construct a hierarchy of semantic categories.
</p>
<aside>
  <b>Note:</b>
  I ended up using a very similar approach in my Masters' thesis, although I did
  not know about Chodorow, Byrd and Heidorn at the time. More precisely, I used
  the wiktionary to construct a lexicon of French human nouns. With a few
  well-chosen genera, you can end up with a fairly large list of words.<br/>
  Another point to stress: not all definitions follow this Aristotelian pattern.
</aside>
<p>
  That's already one fun thing you can do with a dictionary: build a taxonomy
  from definitions! But that's not all you can do. One key application of NLP is
  to build software that tells you which meaning a word has in a given context.
  This <em>word sense disambiguation</em> task, or WSD for short, would be able
  to tell you that in the sentence "The banks of the Meurthe river are ruled by
  ferocious mallards that <em>will fight you</em>", we're using the riverside
  meaning of "bank", but in "In case of a bank robbery, hide under your desk",
  we're using the "building of a money-managing institution".
</p>
<p>
  In 1986, Michael Lesk suggested that one could compare the words in the
  context of our ambiguous target, and those occuring in all of its definitions.
  By selecting the definition that has the most words in common with the
  context, we can disambiguate the word. In practice, it'd go like that: if I
  want to disambiguate the word "banks" in the sentence "The banks of the
  Meurthe river are ruled by ferocious mallards that <em>will fight you</em>", I
  can note that the definition
  <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bank#Noun_2">an edge of river, lake,
  or other watercourse</a> has one word in common with my sentence. That's the
  most I can get from all possible definitions for that word, hence I would
  rightly conclude that this definition is the one that corresponds to the
  meaning of "banks" in this context.
</p>
<p>
  This is obviously not the most accurate way of performing WSD, but it's a
  start. Some authors, e.g., Gaume and Muller in 2004, have suggested
  improvements to Lesk's approach. One simple thing that you can do is to
  explore the dictionary a bit more thoroughly to compute the match between
  context and definition.
</p>
<p>
  Suppose I want to disambiguate the word "duck". One of the definitions that
  Lesk's method would look up is the one that says a duck is
  <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/duck#Noun">an aquatic bird with a flat
  bill and webbed feet</a>. But why stop there? We can also look up the genus
  "bird", viz., <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bird#Noun">an animal,
  characterized by being warm-blooded, having feathers and wings usually capable
  of flight, having a beaked mouth, and laying eggs</a>. As all ducks are also
  birds, these characteristics can also help us disambiguate our word: if the
  words "feathers" or "eggs" appear near the occurrence of "duck" we wish to
  disambiguate, then that's a clue.
</p>
<p>
  As these elements are less specificly related to ducks and apply more
  generally to all sorts of birds, Gaume and Muller consider them as less solid,
  more circumstancial evidence. On the other hand, we don't have to stop at the
  genus: we can see that aquatic things are those
  <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/aquatic#Adjective">relating to water;
  living in or near water, taking place in water</a>; hence if the context
  suggests that our ambiguous duck is near a body of water, then again, that's
  one more clue for us.
</p>
<p>
  That's probably quite a lot to take in. There are obviously a lot more works
  that have used dictionaries, but these few examples give you a general idea of
  how NLP scientists can concretely exploit dictionaries in creative ways. I
  plan to focus on how we can use dictionaries in conjunction with word vectors
  in a future post.
</p>
<p>
  Also, friendly tip: don't feed the ducks, unless you're a seasoned veteran
  grandma that fears no flock of quacking beasts. Ducks <em>will fight you</em>.
