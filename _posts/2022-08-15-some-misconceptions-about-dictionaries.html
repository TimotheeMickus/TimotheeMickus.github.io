  <b>Note:</b> In the previous post, I said I'd "look at a more recent (and
  therefore more complex) DSM architecture" this time around. It turns out more
  complicated than I expected, so I'm not going to do that&mdash;at least not
  today.

  <em>And now, something completely different:</em> a six-hundred words lecture
  on the dictionary.
</p>
<p>
  Half of my thesis (the better half, really) is about distributional semantics
  vectors, which I've introduced over the past installments. The other thing I
  study is dictionary definitions. Let me start today by rectifying some
  misconceptions you may have when it comes to dictionaries.
</p>
<p>
  To start with, let's get rid of the myth that dictionaries were invented
  during the Enlightenment. Dictionaries are <em>very old</em>. The Harrisses
  and Diderots of 18<sup>th</sup> century Europe were building upon a long and
  fairly well established tradition. To give an idea of how old we're talking:
  you'll often hear that the oldest surviving dictionary is the Chinese Erya
  (爾雅), which dates back anywhere from the 6<sup>th</sup> century BC to the
  3<sup>rd</sup> century BC. Most scholars will agree that thus is the earliest
  document that we can recognize as a proper dictionary, but we also have
  glossaries written in cuneiform from the early 2<sup>nd</sup> millenium BC; or
  lexica, such as 4<sup>th</sup> century BC Philitas of Cos' Ἄτακτοι γλῶσσαι
  ("Disorderly words", literally) which listed rare, archaic, dialectal or
  technical words.
</p>
<p>
  Another notion that is worth clarifying is that of prescriptive vs.
  descriptive approaches to language. That distinction is kind of 101
  linguistics class material, but let's quickly review it. Grammar and the like
  tell you "the right way" to use language; they prescribe how words should be
  used. Linguistics, on the other hand, makes no claim about what how you should
  use words: linguists only describe language. As with most 101 classes, it's a
  good first introduction, but oversimplifies some aspects of the debate.
  Sociolinguists will readily distinguish usages based on how close to the
  "social best practice" they are; i.e., whether they fit the norm.
</p>
<p>
  Going back to dictionaries, lexicographers (at least in modern times) are very
  much invested in using a descriptive approach: they document what usages exist
  "in the wild" when writing dictionary definitions. Likewise, there is a rather
  long-standing tradition of linguists working with&mdash;or
  as&mdash;lexicographers. John Rupert Firth, which was previously mentioned in
  this series of post, worked on the Oxford English Dictionary and discussed at
  length the proper methodology for compiling definitions in "Linguistic
  Analysis as a Study of Meaning" (1952). Natalia Shvedova both took over the
  job of compiling definitions for the Russian Ozhegov dictionary after the
  death of the original author, Sergei Ozhegov, and wrote multiple monographs
  and essays on Russian syntax. A whole branch of linguistics, Meaning-Text
  theory, founded by Igort Mel'čuk, is closely tied to the project of producing
  "Explanatory Combinatorial Dictionaries".
</p>
<p>
  The last point that is worth clarifying is that lexicographers are very much
  not opposed to bringing in new technologies in the art of writing definitions.
  Lexicographers frequently use large corpora of texts to see whether their
  definitions describe actual word usage: this is made possible by the existence
  of technology to process and explore these large corpora, such as
  concordancers, computer program that tabulate and display the contexts in
  which a given input word is attested. One concrete example of such software
  would be SketchEngine. Another domain where dictionaries make use of modern
  technology is for data storage. XML, a very popular electronic document format
  widely used today, was developed with the Oxford English Dictionary in mind.

  URL</a>.

<p>
  To sum up: dictionaries are a very well established type of lexical resources.
  Linguists frequently work with dictionaries, and lexicographers are very much
  open to innovation. It should therefore come as no surprise that there is a
  large body of work in NLP centered around using dictionaries. The plan is to
  look at these works next week!
