excerpt: We've talked about word vectors. We've talked about dictionaries. How do we compare them?

  <b>Note:</b> I'm back. The last few months have been hectic, it turns out that
  writing a PhD dissertation is time-consuming. Who would have thought?
</aside>
<p>
  We've talked about word vectors. We've talked about dictionary definitions.
  What's their common point? One thing you could argue is that they both purport
  to describe word meaning. That is fairly obvious when it comes to
  definitions&mdash;I don't think I need to do much convincing there, that's
  just what dictionaries are.
</p>
<p>
  It's perhaps less obvious that we can expect word vectors to be meaning
  representations as well. There are a number of good arguments for that, but
  the one piece of evidence you should keep in mind here is that we don't
  associate words at random when we speak&mdash;shocking, I know! In fact, we
  use words based on what they mean. So we can expect that the context in which
  we use a word (i.e., what we called its distribution) tells us something of its
  meaning. That is something we've discussed at greater lengths in a previous post
  (<a href="https://timotheemickus.github.io/my-phd-explained-to-my-folks/2021/07/25/the-basics-of-distributional-semantics.html">post
  #4 here</a>).
</p>
<p>
  But is the meaning of word vectors the same as the meaning of definitions?
</p>
<p>
  I know this sounds like a gibberish question. There are two key points I'd
  like you to keep in mind before you start booing too loudly. First, the word
  vectors that we have are constructed from large amounts of data using software.
  Moreover, they use estimation techniques like gradient descent
  (<a href="https://timotheemickus.github.io/my-phd-explained-to-my-folks/2021/08/29/gradient-descent-into-madness.html">see
  post #8 here</a>). These techniques are neither deterministic nor precise: we
  have no guarantee that what we end up with is the most optimal product we'd
  set out for.
</p>
<p>
  The second point I'd like you to keep in mind is that nobody knows what meaning
  is in the first place. Or at least it's very much an open debate in linguistics.
  One thing you can say for sure is that the "meaning of sentences" and the
  "meaning of words" are different kinds of beast, as they have very different
  properties&mdash;for instance, you can say whether a sentence is true or false,
  but it's entirely meaningless to ponder whether that sentence is a synonym of
  "gorse".
</p>
<aside class="">
  <b>Note:</b> Here's a massive old can of worms that we're going to abruptly
  shelve away because I don't have time for this right now! <br>
  First, truth does not apply to all sentences. Here's a simple example:
 "Which of my pet rabbits has black and white spots?" This sentence is neither
 true nor false. It has a true answer (he's called Midas, and the most acute
 of my readers might have seen him in a picture), but in and of itself, a
 question is neither true nor false. <br>
 Second, we also have declarative sentences that are neither true nor false in
 the classical sense of "saying something that matches with how the world is":
 the classic example being "The current king of France is bald." There's
 no such thing as a current king of France, so it's hard to say whether that sentence
 is true or false&mdash;it presupposes facts that are false, but does that
 make it false or simply unrelated to the real world? and what about "Crusoe
 was lost on an island."? That also presupposes false facts (namely, that
 Robinson Crusoe existed), and yet we're not so eager to say it's false.<br>
 Third, we have words like "unicorns" or "wizards" or "dragons" which have no
 counterpart in the real world. As such, when you use them, you can end up
 with a sentence that will necessarily presuppose false facts. There's a
 distinction between what using the word in a sentence entails and what this
 word itself means.<br>
 Fourth, there are languages (many, in fact), where single words can be
 sentences all on their own. We have a bunch in English as well, e.g., "Yes"
 or "No" as a reply to some question. But some languages like Nahuatl turn
 that to eleven: the word "ticitl" means "doctor" or "that person is a doctor",
 depending on context, and (if I remember correctly) the word
 "onamechmonaquilizinco" is a conjugated form of the verb "namiqui" (which
 means "to meet") that roughly translates to "I came here to meet you with the
 utmost respect." Or something like that, I'm not an expert in Nahuatl. We
 call these languages synthetic or polysynthetic, if you want to look it up.
</aside>
<p>
  We don't know what "word-meaning" is. Therefore, we're not certain that the
  concept of meaning that we implicitly rely on when we read or make up
  definitions is any different from the concept of word-meaning that we can
  study through distribution. It's not a trivial question without consequences
  either. Whenever we have two different scientific accounts for the same set of
  facts, it's worth sitting down to see whether that difference is merely
  cosmetic or whether it has deeper implications.
</p>
<p>
  For instance, heliocentrism and describing the movement of planets using
  epicycloids (that's saying they trace spirograph patterns in the night sky,
  basically) is at the end of the day more or less equivalent mathematically
  speaking. What changes here is the optics of it: heliocentrism is a lot more
  economical, and means we don't have to treat Earth in a special way&mdash;we
  apply the same rules to this planet and to all the other. Don't get me wrong,
  optics <em>do</em> matter: having the right scientific framweork helps a lot
  when trying to build on previous results and theories.
</p>
<aside class="">
  <b>Note:</b> The hackneyed example for that idea states that "Hesperus (aka.
  the Evening Star) is Phosphorus (aka. the Morning Star)," both of these being
  names given to Venus depending on when it appears in the night sky. That's a
  fairly overused example which we owe to Frege's <em>Ãœber Sinn und
  Bedeutung</em>.<br>
  Also, re-reading myself, I'm having a doubt as to whether epicycloids and
  heliocentrism are strictly equivalent, mathematically speaking. Please pretend
  my argument works.
</aside>
<p>
  The second type of difference is more similar to that between Newtonian
  gravity and Enstein's general relativity. These theories are not mathematically
  equivalent: they predict different orbits for the planet Mercury. So you can't
  just say that they mean the same thing: at most one of the two can describe
  accurately the motions of planets; simply put, they describe different facts.
</p>
<p>
  Going back to word-meaning, it's worth asking which of the two situations
  we're in. Are definitions and word distributions equivalent descriptions of
  meaning? If so, then that would make for a very enlightening difference in
  optics which might help us to better understand what word-meaning is,
  fundamentally speaking. If not, then we'll have two competing descriptions of
  word-meaning, and we'll have to look into whether either of those does not
  match reality.

  The next few posts are going to be about methods to compare word embeddings and
  definitions, but I'll stop here for today. See you next week!
