  Every conversation where I try to explain what exactly is my PhD about goes more
  or less like that: "You know Google translate? Well, NLP is the field of study
  that cover that kind of applications". And then we swiftly shift topics, for the
  great relief of everyone involved.

  On the other hand, it's not like NLP is so arcane and abstruse. Most of the
  complexity is that the field of NLP is brand new. Take for instance physics:
  the idea that some sort of mathematical contraption should be able to describe
  the motion of objects or the way light refracts through a lens is <em>old</em>: older
  than Newton, if you look into it.
</p>
<p>
  On the other hand, the study of linguistics, as its own separate thing, distinct
  from comparative grammar, philology or literature is generally traced back to
  Ferdinand de Saussure, who died roughly a century ago. The idea that you could
  use a machine to translate texts is even younger (right after World War II).
  Given how new linguistics and NLP is, you shouldn't expect the general public
  to be very familiar with it. We just haven't had the time to come up with
  easy-to-understand explanations yet.
</p>
<p>
  And surely <em>I</em>'m going to solve this problem right away (lol).
</p>
<p>
  I'm not much of a science communicator. I don't like talking to people. On the
  other hand, I'm not really satisfied with the current state of vulgarization in
  NLP and linguistics. A lot of what has been written has been written by
  generativists (or people who read mostly generativist papers), and it's not like
  this framework is without problems. Well, you'll probably hear me rant against
  Chomsky at some point, because that's who I am.
</p>
<p>
  Another reason why I'm doing this is that public researchers should make their
  research available to the public. That's also one of the core tennets of the
  OLKi project (the ones who fund my PhD, check them out
  <a href="http://lue.univ-lorraine.fr/en/open-language-and-knowledge-citizens-olki">here</a>).
  Yet another reason is that my folks actually want to know what my PhD is about,
  and what better way to do that than rant my heart out on the internet for all to
  see?
</p>
<p>
  Anyways, here's the pitch: I'll try to go over the basics of NLP. I'll steer
  away from most of the technical stuff (some of it is necessary though). I'll
  try to be as clear and jargon-free as possible. I'll try to post at least once
  a week, perhaps more if I get the time, perhaps a short post if I don't get it.
  The goal is that whenever I'm done with this series of posts, you, poor reader
  who stumbled here, will have a general picture of the topic I'm
  studying&mdash;independently of whether or not you've had classes in
  linguistics, calculus, philosophy of language, and so on.
</p>
<p>
  If you're still not sold: I promise there will be octopuses, talking robots,
  rabbits (or shapes of rabbits&mdash;who knows!), and more dimensions than even
  string theory has.
