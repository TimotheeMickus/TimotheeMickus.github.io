  Let's play a <em>fun</em> game! I'll give you a type of scientist, and you'll
  answer with what they do. Well, there's only me here right now, so I'll have to
  play on my own, but whatever. Game start!
</p>

<p>
  <b>Geologists?</b> they study rocks and pebbles. <b>Astronomers?</b> they use
  big telescopes to look at stars and space things. <b>Mathematicians?</b> they
  study numbers! Or geometric figures. Or stuff like that. <b>Biologists?</b>
  they study life and living things in general, and how they live.
  <b>Sociologists?</b> They study society. <b>Linguists?</b> They study
  language, and that's very cool.
</p>
<p>
  "Okay, that game is easy!" or so you say. Well, I'm sure your answers must have
  irked some colleagues to be fair, but yeah, you got the gist pretty quickly.
  There's generally "one big thing", one core topic of research in a scientific
  field, and you can always hearken back to that starting idea. But it's not
  entirely accurate.
</p>
<p>
  Going back to biologists: they do study life, but the angle adopted in biology
  is rather specific. Sure, they study life and living things, but they adopt a
  mechanistic view of life: how life functions, so to speak. They do not discuss
  what is the meaning of life; instead they describe the chemistry needed for a
  microbe to propagate in your body, or how much force can the muscles in a
  kangaroo's leg exert. If want to study the meaning of life, then you should
  probably study philosophy or theology or something of the sort.
</p>
<p>
  Now let's go back to linguists. Earlier, you said that linguists study language
  (and also that it was very cool, and it was very kind of you; thanks, that does
  wonders to my self-esteem to hear that kind of stuff). We linguists do study
  language, but there are many ways you can study language. You can have a look
  at how  Shakespeare's verses are written, and how they differ from the style of
  Blake&mdash;that's language. You can do like the <em>Académie des Immortels
  Peut-être Trop Poussiéreux</em>, and ponder deeply about the <em>proper</em>
  gender of the word "covid" and wonder whether every single French speaker got
  it wrong all this time&mdash;that looks extremely silly to me, but again,
  technically, you're dealing with language.
</p>
<p>
  <em>Linguistics</em> is really about describing idioms and dialects, like how
  biologists describe living things. We can expect all languages to share some
  features, as they all are manifestations of the human capacity to communicate
  with sounds or gestures&mdash;just like you can expect living things to be made
  of proteins, genes and cells.
</p>
<aside>
  <b>Note:</b> to the biology nerds who shot up shouting "<em>viruses!</em>":
  please calm down. You're not helping. We're trying to help my folks here, okay?
</aside>
<p>
  Linguists are mostly focused on describing human language&mdash;unlike
  the French <em>Académie</em> that is interested in prescribing the "correct
  usage" (whatever that means). To a linguist, the question of correction is only
  relevant in that it can influence the view that speakers have of their own
  speech. Linguists are also not necessarily focused on the style and literary
  value of specific pieces of text; although they can be, insofar as literary
  significance is a useful concept when describing language.
</p>
<p>
  In short, linguists can contrast and compare Globish to how Queen Elizabeth
  speaks, but they won't decry the former and revere the latter. Linguists can
  consider that rhyme schemes and fixed meters are formal markers of French
  classical poetry just like Verlan denotes modern popular French speech.
</p>
<p>
  So I'm a linguist. More precisely, I'm a computational linguist or a NLP
  scientist, depending on whom you talk to. Computational linguistics (CL) is the
  sub-field of linguistics that further takes a computational approach to language.
  NLP stands for Natural Language Processing, and the field it covers is very much
  adjacent to CL, but I'll leave that can of worm for the next instalment.
  The sort of questions I'm working on generally boil down to "can you set up a
  mathematical model of some aspect of language? And what can you learn from
  that model?"
</p>
<p>
  This is probably very abstract. Let's take an example. Let's suppose you're
  trying to learn German, but, sadly, you can't for the life of you remember the
  grammatical gender of German nouns. Now, you could wallow in grief, or you could look
  into whether these genders are truly completely random. There are two things we
  can expect to play a role. The first one is word meaning: if you have masculine and
  feminine genders, a naive assumption you can make is that <em>woman</em> be a
  feminine word, and <em>man</em> be a masculine one; likewise if you have animate and
  inanimate genders, then <em>human</em> should be animate, whereas <em>pebble</em>
  is probably not.
</p>
<aside>
  <b>Note:</b> Yes, I hear you screaming at me that <em>Mädchen</em> is neuter,
  not feminine. A) Please stop screaming, the biologists from earlier
  already wore me out. B) Language is messy, that's why it's fun to study.
</aside>
<p>
  The other thing you can expect to play a role is word frequency; i.e., how often
  a given word is used on average. That's because frequency always plays a role, or
  to be precise, it always messes with our experiments in computational linguistics.
</p>
<p>
  Back to our original question: is grammatical gender in German completely random?
  Or do meaning and frequency play a significant role? Well, a computational
  linguist would measure, correlate and plot these two factors, and study
  what they get from all their measurements.
</p>
<p>
  And in fact, you can find some sort of patterns. For instance, things with
  similar meanings will tend to have the same grammatical gender (e.g., <em>Tee</em>,
  <em>Saft</em>, <em>Kaffee</em> are all masculine in German), except for the
  most common item in the group (and <em>Wasser</em> is indeed neuter). The
  pattern is not systematic, yet it does suggest that genders are not random but
  highly informative. They help speakers of German to  distinguish between
  situations on the basis of how mundane or exceptional they appear to be:
  drinking water is perhaps less noteworthy than drinking coffee.
</p>
<p>
  A computational linguist will attempt to be systematic in their study (like
  any other scientist). To do so, they would devise or adapt existings metrics
  to <em>quantify</em> this degree of informativity, and check whether it
  generalizes at a larger scale than our select collection of beverages.
</p>
<aside>
  <b>Note:</b> Credit where it is due, this German gender example is in fact
  <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318013522_A_Functional_Theory_of_Gender_Paradigms">
  a paper by Melody Dye and colleagues, published in 2017</a>.

<p>
  This mathematical approach to language also means that it will be easier to
  couple linguistics with computers and technology in general. For a computer,
  the mathematical models of language we build will be easier to handle than the
  raw noisy mess of our daily exchanges. I promise I'll speak more about this
  aspect next week.
</p>
<p>
  So there you have it! I'm a computational linguist, and I try to study language
  through computations. One question you may have is why: why am I interested in
  this rather obscure sub-domain of linguistics. I'll try to go a bit deeper into
  the weeds in future instalments of this series, but for now, I'll just mention
  two reasons.
</p>
<p>
  The first is that computational models of language are global descriptions of
  languages. I generally have to deal with all the data available at once, instead
  of selecting observations that corresponds to the problem I study. I find that
  angle of study more appropriate to my understanding of language, but I'll save
  the full explanation for an upcoming rant.
</p>
<p>
  The second, and perhaps the most important reason, is that I want to build
  talking robots, damn it!
