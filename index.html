            I'm Timothee Mickus, a postdoc at the University of Helsinki;
            I'm involved in the ERC-funded <a href="https://blogs.helsinki.fi/language-technology/fotran/">FoTran</a> project
            led by <a href="https://blogs.helsinki.fi/tiedeman/">Jörg Tiedemann</a>.

            I recently finished my PhD at <a href="https://www.atilf.fr/">ATILF</a>,
            under the supervision of <a href="https://perso.atilf.fr/mconstant/">Mathieu Constant</a>
            and <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/denispaperno/">Denis Paperno</a> at Utrecht University.
            You can read the whole thing <a href="http://docnum.univ-lorraine.fr/public/DDOC_T_2022_0066_MICKUS.pdf">here</a>.
            My PhD research topic was on distributional semantics and dictionaries:
            do dictionary definitions depict meaning in the same way as neural networks-based word vectors?
            Can we come up with quantitative ways of measuring how similar these two theories are?
            This PhD was funded by the <a href="http://lue.univ-lorraine.fr/en/open-language-and-knowledge-citizens-olki">OLKi project</a>.
            It received an <a href="https://www.atala.org/prix-these">award</a> from the ATALA, the French scientific society for NLP.

            I hold a Masters in Computational Linguistics from the now-Université de Paris
            <a href="https://www.linguist.univ-paris-diderot.fr/cursusli">Computational Linguistics curriculum</a>.
            My thesis was on distributional effects of grammatical gender contrasts on French human nouns,
            which you can read <a href="/pdf/masters.pdf" download>here</a>.

            I'm currently organizing a shared task for next year's SemEval with a number of colleagues from Helsinki and beyond. 
            It's called SHROOM, a Shared-task on Hallucinations and Related Observable Overgeneration Mistakes.
            More info available (and to appear) on the <a href="https://helsinki-nlp.github.io/shroom/">SHROOM task website</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm also organizing a workshop for this year's EACL, on Modular and Open Multilingual NLP, or MOOMIN for short.
            Check <a href="https://moomin-workshop.github.io">the website</a> for details!
